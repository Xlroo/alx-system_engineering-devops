Root Cause

At 8:00 AM EAT , students reported not being able to access the exam portal. The authentication service was down due to unmade payments that forced the service provider to shut the service. It was later found out that the service provider has not been paid for the last 6 months owing to a leadership transition in the university that halted some of the finance process. On further inquiry a few budget cuts were made by the school board citing dwindling funding by the government.

Resolution and recovery

At 8:26 AM EAT ,the IT department was notified of the problem and immediately looked to resolve it.

At 9:24 AM EAT , we advised the faculty and school to offer alternative examination methods as the problem would take time to resolve .

On 203/2025 7:15 PM EAT , the database services were restored and eLearning services became accessible.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

We conducted an analysis of the problem and put in place some measures to prevent it in future:
Create alerts for pending infrastructure payments 
Move to a cloud provider that is cheaper 
Manage payment schedules for core infrastructure service for the school
Coordinate academic faculty and IT team to understand the availability of certain online services and offer an alternative a week before the event.
Fix the underlying authentication libraries and monitoring to correctly timeout/interrupt on errors.
Reduce time to response by integrating call management systems .
